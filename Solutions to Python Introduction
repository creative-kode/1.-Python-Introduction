It's practice time!

Let's start the practice by solving the given project to improve our programming skills

Our code needs to be executed to get results for that we use IDEs.

List of ide(integrated development environment):

IDLE

You can download any of the IDE to practice python programs. IDLE and Jupyter notebook are best for beginners.

Practice Question_1: 

In school, a girl named Jessy wants to learn a poem that was taught by a teacher in school, but she doesn't remember all the lines of a poem.
Can you help her to learn a poem by writing it in python and display it on the screen?.
So that she can watch on the screen and practice so that she can easily learn it.

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky. 

SOLUTION:

print('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,')
print('How I wonder what you are!')
print('Up above the world so high,')
print('Like a diamond in the sky.')

OUTPUT:
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
